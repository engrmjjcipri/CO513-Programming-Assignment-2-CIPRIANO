# CO513-Programming-Assignment-2-CIPRIANO

A short ARMv7 assembly program for the DE1-SoC (CPUlator) that implements a two-digit counter (00–59) displayed on the HEX1:HEX0 7-segment displays. The counter supports count up or count down operation, controlled by a pushbutton (KEY) and switch input, and includes debouncing to ensure reliable and stable button detection.
